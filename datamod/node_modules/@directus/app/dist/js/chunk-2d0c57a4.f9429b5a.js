If you have _any_ questions along the way, please reach out to our Core team on\n> [Discord](https://directus.chat).\n\n## Node Monorepo\n\nOur Node.js repository is located at `directus/directus` and houses the Admin App (Vue.js 3),\nNode.js API, project documentation (Markdown), API Specification (OpenAPI), and other smaller\npackages used internally. Directus follows a monorepo design similar to React or Babel â€” to learn\nmore about our monorepo's design and structure, see our [Codebase Overview](#codebase-overview)\nbelow.\n\nTo contribute to the project, please follow the instructions located within our GitHub repository's\n[contributing.md file](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/contributing.md).\n\n\x3c!--\n@TODO\n\n::: tip PHP API Port\nWhile the Node.js version of Directus defines the official specification and is\nour team's primary focus, we also support a community-lead PHP API port in Laravel. This secondary\ncodebase is located in a separate git repository at [`directus/php`](#).\n::: --\x3e\n\n## Feature Requests\n\nFeature requests are a great way to let our team know what should be prioritized next. You can\n[submit a feature request](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/category_choices) or\nupvote [existing submissions](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions) all via our GitHub\nDiscussions board.\n\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-start --\x3e\n::: warning The 80/20 Rule\nTo keep the Directus codebase as clean and simple as possible, we will\nonly consider approving features that we feel at least 80% of our user-base will find valuable. If\nyour feature request falls within the 20% range, it is considered an edge-case and should be\nimplemented as an extension.\n:::\n\x3c!-- prettier-ignore-end --\x3e\n\n## RFCs\n\nSome Directus features/fixes may require additional design, strategy, and/or discussion before\nbeginning work. For these notable pull-requests, you should first submit an RFC (Request For\nComments) to our core team via [Discord](https://directus.chat). This process is relatively\ninformal, but ensures proper alignment, and helps avoid squandered development time by contributors.\n\n## Bug Reporting\n\nReporting any bugs you come across is an invaluable part of helping keep Directus stable. After\nconfirming a similar issue doesn't already exist, you can\n[submit a bug report](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/new) via GitHub Issues. Please\nensure the following for all submissions:\n\n-   You are experiencing an actual bug, not a configuration issue\n-   You are not asking a question or requesting a new feature\n-   You have checked that no similar issue already exists\n-   You have entered a clear and concise title\n-   You have followed the issue template, with stack details and steps to reproduce\n-   You have already tried the following troubleshooting steps:\n    -   You are on the latest version of Directus\n    -   You have stopped (`CTRL+C`) and restarted the server\n    -   You have confirmed the issue is not related to your own custom code\n    -   Dev Only: You have cleared and reinstalled all dependencies\n\nPlease make sure to include all information required to reproduce your exact setup and issue in the\nissue report.\n\n## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIf you believe you have discovered a security issue within a Directus product or service, please\nreach out to us directly over email: [security@directus.io](mailto:security@directus.io). We will\nthen open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories) for\ntracking the fix.\n\nWe value the members of the independent security research community who find security\nvulnerabilities and work with our team so that proper fixes can be issued to users. Our policy is to\ncredit all researchers in the fix's release notes. In order to receive credit, security researchers\nmust follow responsible disclosure practices, including:\n\n-   They do not publish the vulnerability prior to the Directus team releasing a fix for it\n-   They do not divulge exact details of the issue, for example, through exploits or\n    proof-of-concepts\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThe Directus [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md) is\none of the ways we put our values into practice. We expect all of our staff, contractors and\ncontributors to know and follow this code.\n\n## Development Workflow\n\nBefore getting started, ensure you your local environment meets our\n[minimum requirements](/guides/installation/cli) and you are familiar with Git.\n\n### 1. Fork the Directus repository\n\nGo to the [repository](https://github.com/directus/directus) and fork it to your GitHub account.\n\n### 2. Clone from your repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/next.git\n```\n\n### 3. Make a new branch\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME\n```\n\n### 4. Install the dependencies\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n### 5. Setup the Database & Env File\n\nFor this step, you'll need to already have a SQL database up-and-running, otherwise you can only use\nthe SQLite driver, which will create the database for you. Run the following command from within\nroot of the project:\n\n```bash\nnpm run cli -- init\n```\n\n### 6. Start the development server\n\nRun the following command from the root directory.\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### 7. Make your fixes/changes\n\nAt this point you are ready to start working on Directus! Before diving in however, it's worth\nreading through our docs on [submitting a pull-request](#Submitting-a-Pull-Request).\n\n## Submitting a Pull-Request\n\n### 1. Submit an RFC (if needed)\n\nPlease read our docs on the [RFC process](#rfcs).\n\n### 2. Update relevant docs\n\nBefore submitting any pull-requests, ensure that any relevant documentation (included in this same\nrepo) is updated.\n\n### 3. Push your changes\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin YOUR-BRANCH-NAME\n```\n\n### Submit a pull-request\n\nOnce you push the changes to your repo, the \"Compare & pull request\" button will appear in GitHub.\nClick it and you'll be taken to a screen where you can fill in the appropriate details. Finally,\nopen the pull request by clicking the \"Create pull request\" button.\n\nNow our core staff will review your contribution and either merge it, or request that you to make\nchanges.\n\n## Codebase Overview\n\n### `/api`\n\nContains the Directus API (REST+GraphQL), written in node.js.\n\n### `/app`\n\nContains the Directus Admin App, written in Vue.js 3.\n\n### `/docs`\n\nContains all the platform's documentation, written in markdown with additional VuePress formatting.\n"}}]);
